I'm a Software Developer with an aptitude for problem solving and learning. Throughout my career journey I have acquired a knack for UI/UX, fullstack development, and customer facing roles.

My mission is to use all the tools I have acquired in Software Development, my work experiences and my multicultural background to have a significant impact on my team to help improve efficiency and the user experience.

I am looking for a role in a growing company working towards creating new and innovative products that can impact the world in a positive way.

Some hobbies include golf, weightlifting, and solving challanging problems.
